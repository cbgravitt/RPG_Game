# RPG_Game
This game is incomplete! The first draft will be a simple text-based RPG (similar to Titan Conqeust, the text RPG).
The first few versions will run in the terminal, with future versions hopefully taking advantage of some python game libraries,
and maybe even expanding online with HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL! (Plans for this are tentative, but in progress...)
At the moment, there are two incomplete files in this game: RPG_Class.py, and RPG_main.py. 
Each will be flushed out in the future, so this file is just to state what they will do once completed.

# RPG_Class
This RPG is made in Python, but it is an object-oriented program. This file is for the class functions and properties.

# RPG_Main
This will have the main gameplay loop, including a save feature.

# RPG_Items
Holds all items currently in the game. Some comments describing future features are also in this file.
